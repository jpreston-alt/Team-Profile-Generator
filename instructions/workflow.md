# Work-flow

## Create Classes & Pass Unit Tests
1. Employee
1. Engineer
1. Intern
1. Manager

## Create HTML templates for each type of user
1. Employee
1. Engineer
1. Intern
1. Manager

## Logic/ app.js
1. use inquirer to prompt questions and generate new object for each team member
1. render each employee object using the correct HTML template based on their position
1. write an HTML file containing the HTML templates returned form the render function

// Write code to use inquirer to gather information about the development team members,
// and to create objects for each team member (using the correct classes as blueprints!)

// After the user has input all employees desired, call the `render` function (required
// above) and pass in an array containing all employee objects; the `render` function will
// generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!

// After you have your html, you're now ready to create an HTML file using the HTML
// returned from the `render` function. Now write it to a file named `team.html` in the
// `output` folder. You can use the variable `outputPath` above target this location.
// Hint: you may need to check if the `output` folder exists and create it if it
// does not.

// HINT: each employee type (manager, engineer, or intern) has slightly different
// information; write your code to ask different questions via inquirer depending on
// employee type.

// HINT: make sure to build out your classes first! Remember that your Manager, Engineer,
// and Intern classes should all extend from a class named Employee; see the directions
// for further information. Be sure to test out each class and verify it generates an
// object with the correct structure and methods. This structure will be crucial in order
// for the provided `render` function to work! ```
